# AI Salary Predictor  

## Overview  

The **AI Salary Predictor** is an AI-based system designed to help HR departments determine appropriate salaries for AI professionals. It bridges the gap between salary expectations and industry standards by analyzing multiple factors such as experience level, job title, company size, and location.  

## Problem Statement  

AI professionals often face challenges when trying to understand salary expectations across different regions and job levels. Employers, in turn, need insights into competitive salary ranges to attract top talent.  
The lack of transparency and up-to-date salary data can lead to misalignment between expectations and reality. This project addresses the gap by building a system that analyzes and predicts AI salaries based on various factors.  

## Features  

- **Accurate Predictions:** Uses AI models to predict salaries based on industry data.  
- **Customizable Input:** Allows users to input different factors like experience, location, and job type.
